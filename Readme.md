# AT-26 Chuck
This project allow the use of a Wii Nunchuck for playing games with Atari 2600 and other video-games with compatible joystick port (like ZX Spectrum w/ Kempston).

The heart of the circuit is a PIC microcontroller that converts I2C data from Wii Nunchuck. into pressing of switches on the Atari Joystick.

The device can be programmed into several modes of operation, with or without the accelerometers and auto-fire. The configuration is stored in EEPROM.

All components are through hole and the board can be easily built at home.
